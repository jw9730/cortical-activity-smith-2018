function fftshow(f,type)
% Usage: FFTSHOW(F,TYPE)
%
% Displays the fft matrix F using imshow, where TYPE must be one of
% 'abs' or 'log'. If TYPE='abs', then then abs(f) is displayed; if
% TYPE='log' then log(1+abs(f)) is displayed. If TYPE is omitted, then
% 'log' is chosen as a default.
%
% Example:
% c=imread('cameraman.tif');
% cf=fftshift(fft2(c));
% fftshow(cf,'abs')
%
if nargin<2,
type='log';
end
if (type=='log')
fl = log(1+abs(f));
fm = max(fl(:));
imshow(im2uint8(fl/fm))
elseif (type=='abs')
fa=abs(f);
fm=max(fa(:));
imshow(fa/fm)
else
error('TYPE must be abs or log.');
end;
